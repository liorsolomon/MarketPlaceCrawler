MarketPlaceCrawler
==================

Keep tracking your rating on the different market places!
This project aims to help us track automatically comments we get on the various appstores.
In case you have several products running on several platforms/appstores you better know ASAP if someone isn't 
happy with the new release you just uploaded to the market.

MarketPlaceCrawler will scrap all the markets you are publishing to and will email you any new comment submitted.
